**Flying**
You can craft hang gliders to fly without an elytra.

To use a hang glider, hold it in either hand, and right click while falling. Firework rockets don't work with hang gliders.

**Trains**
Sneak and right click a minecart to start a chain, then right click another minecart to create a link. Linked carts travel with each other, like a train!

Place gravel under rails to make minecarts run at top speed.
