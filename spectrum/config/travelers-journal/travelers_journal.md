Use <dark_green>/polydex<>, then search for "anchor" to see all the recipes.

Use <dark_green>/goml help<> to see how to add other players to your claim.

**Flying**
You can craft hang gliders to fly without an elytra.

To use a hang glider, hold it in either hand, and right click while falling. Firework rockets don't work with hang gliders.
